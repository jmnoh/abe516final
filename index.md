# Project Summary 1

Summary of the project

## Interesting question


> What is the effect of the two treatments (new coated sweep and worn sweep)on the soil profile (making seedbed), as measured by the lidar sensor? 
> A simple observation if the plant heights are different from two tillage treatments


## data description

Lidar data excel file, First of all, was derived from the LiDAR software and then useful data was selected and calculated mean, min, max and roughness value from each observations by matlab.


```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

df = pd.read_csv('/Users/jongnoh/Desktop/2022_2021_LidarData/LiDar_Seedbed_2022.csv', sep = ',') #you can change this directory for your preference
df.tail 

```

```python
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end
```

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

### Definition lists can be used with HTML syntax.

```
Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
